NAME:
   cloudflared tunnel - Use Cloudflare Tunnel to expose private services to the Internet or to Cloudflare connected private users.

USAGE:
   cloudflared tunnel [global options] command [command options]  

DESCRIPTION:
   Cloudflare Tunnel allows to expose private services without opening any ingress port on this machine. It can expose:
     A) Locally reachable HTTP-based private services to the Internet on DNS with Cloudflare as authority (which you can
   then protect with Cloudflare Access).
     B) Locally reachable TCP/UDP-based private services to Cloudflare connected private users in the same account, e.g.,
   those enrolled to a Zero Trust WARP Client.
   
   You can manage your Tunnels via one.dash.cloudflare.com. This approach will only require you to run a single command
   later in each machine where you wish to run a Tunnel.
   
   Alternatively, you can manage your Tunnels via the command line. Begin by obtaining a certificate to be able to do so:
   
     $ cloudflared tunnel login
   
   With your certificate installed you can then get started with Tunnels:
   
     $ cloudflared tunnel create my-first-tunnel
     $ cloudflared tunnel route dns my-first-tunnel my-first-tunnel.mydomain.com
     $ cloudflared tunnel run --hello-world my-first-tunnel
   
   You can now access my-first-tunnel.mydomain.com and be served an example page by your local cloudflared process.
   
   For exposing local TCP/UDP services by IP to your privately connected users, check out:
   
     $ cloudflared tunnel route ip --help
   
   See https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/ for more info.

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --config value           Specifies a config file in YAML format.
   --origincert value       Path to the certificate generated for your origin when you run cloudflared login. [$TUNNEL_ORIGIN_CERT]
   --autoupdate-freq value  Autoupdate frequency. Default is 24h0m0s. (default: 24h0m0s)
   --no-autoupdate          Disable periodic check for updates, restarting the server with the new version. (default: false) [$NO_AUTOUPDATE]
   --metrics value          Listen address for metrics reporting. If no address is passed cloudflared will try to bind to [localhost:20241 localhost:20242 localhost:20243 localhost:20244 localhost:20245].
If all are unavailable, a random port will be used. Note that when running cloudflared from an virtual
environment the default address binds to all interfaces, hence, it is important to isolate the host
and virtualized host network stacks from each other (default: "localhost:0") [$TUNNEL_METRICS]

This is a uuid. To make it easier to identify a connector, we will use the hostname of the machine the tunnel is running on along with the connector ID. This option exists if one wants to have more control over what their individual connectors are called.
